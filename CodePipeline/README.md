# CloudFormation Template: ecs_pipeline.yml

This CloudFormation template deploys an ECS pipeline for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) of your application.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying this template, make sure you have the following:

- An existing Amazon ECS cluster
- An Amazon S3 bucket to store your application artifacts
- An AWS CodeCommit repository or an external Git repository

## Deployment Steps

Follow these steps to deploy the ECS pipeline:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ecs-pipeline.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the `ecs-pipeline` directory:
    ```bash
    cd ecs-pipeline
    ```

3. Modify the `ecs_pipeline.yml` file to customize the pipeline settings according to your requirements.

4. Deploy the CloudFormation stack using the AWS CLI:
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name ecs-pipeline --template-body file://ecs_pipeline.yml --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
    ```

5. Monitor the stack creation progress in the AWS CloudFormation console.

6. Once the stack creation is complete, the ECS pipeline will be ready for use.

## Usage

To use the ECS pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Push your application code changes to the configured repository.

2. The pipeline will automatically trigger a build and deploy the updated application to the ECS cluster.

3. Monitor the pipeline execution in the AWS CodePipeline console.

## Cleanup

To delete the ECS pipeline and associated resources, run the following command:
