# Secure Notes Manager - Infrastructure and Deployment

This repository contains CloudFormation templates and documentation for the Secure Notes Manager application's infrastructure and deployment.

## Overview

### Purpose

The Secure Notes Manager is a web application designed for managing personal notes securely. This project leverages AWS services for container orchestration, infrastructure automation, and secure deployments.

### Technologies in Use

- **TLS Configuration:**
  - Utilize AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for managing TLS certificates.
  - Configure Nginx to enforce HTTPS using certificates from ACM.

- **Infrastructure Automation:**
  - Use Ansible for initial infrastructure setup (if needed), such as creating VPCs, subnets, security groups, and necessary IAM roles.
  - Alternatively, leverage AWS CloudFormation or Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.

- **CI/CD Pipelines:**
  - Implement a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline.
  - Connect your repository (e.g., GitHub) to trigger the pipeline on code changes.
  - Use AWS CodeBuild to build Docker images and push them to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

- **Container Orchestration:**
  - Deploy the application to AWS Fargate, a serverless compute engine for containers, instead of managing EC2 instances directly.
  - Leverage AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Fargate launch type for simplified container management.

- **Nginx Configuration:**
  - Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy to the application running on Fargate.
  - Implement security headers and settings in Nginx configuration.

- **Application Security Practices:**
  - Implement user authentication and authorization in the web application.
  - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for managing access to AWS resources.
  - Apply security headers, sanitize user input, and follow best practices to prevent common web vulnerabilities.

## Workflow

- **User Access:**
  - Users access the Secure Notes Manager via a secure HTTPS connection, with TLS certificates managed by ACM.

- **Infrastructure Provisioning:**
  - Use Ansible, AWS CloudFormation, or Terraform for initial infrastructure setup, focusing on essential resources.

- **CI/CD Pipeline:**
  - AWS CodePipeline automates the build and deployment process.
  - CodeBuild creates Docker images and pushes them to Amazon ECR.

- **Container Orchestration:**
  - AWS Fargate handles the orchestration of Docker containers, eliminating the need for managing EC2 instances directly.

- **Nginx Security:**
  - Nginx acts as a reverse proxy, enhancing security with appropriate headers and settings.

- **Application Security:**
  - User data is secured through authentication and authorization.
  - Security best practices, including input validation and sanitation, are followed to prevent common vulnerabilities.
